1,29,Female,Software Engineer,Bondi,TRUE,,5,5,5,5,"I love this place, fantastic pizza and great service. It's family run and it shows. Out of heaps of good local options it is still the best. I'd forgotten what friendly service at a takeaway shop was like - only used to get that in my home town. Love their cheap pricing - they are the only shop around that sells $20 pizzas still. Parking: Always plenty of spots"
2,45,Male,Teacher,Parramatta,FALSE,,5,5,5,5,"This is a hidden gem in my suburb!  My husband and I were sick of instagram pretty restaurants and was looking for a really good pizza place. I really love this place! The owners were so welcoming and they all had a lovely smile. Place is hidden away, but kept very clean. We ordered Porto pizza and Marinara pasta. We finished it very quickly because it was so delicious! Loved the thin crispy base and the toppings were just right! We would definitely come back here and would order takeaways when we have friends over at our place. This is my first time leaving google review and I really would recommend to everyone who is craving homey & good pizza and pasta place :) 10/10 recommend! If you want direction email me at personalemail@gmail.com, or call me on 0415623457!"
3,33,Female,Graphic Designer,Surry Hills,FALSE,,5,5,5,,"Friends introduced us to this pizza shop with a home delivery a couple of years ago, and we have ordered from here ever since. Their Pizzas are always excellent and you get exactly what you ordered, along with some friendly customer service as well. Thanks ?? we'll be ordering again soon"
4,52,Male,Sales Manager,Manly,FALSE,,4,,,,Pizza is top drawer but the pasta was a little lacking got a vegetarian delight which is amazing.  The pasta when opened didn't fill the container maybe a little less then three thirds full and the taste whilst ok pretty much was just pasta and sauce. Overall though pleasant chef and when you see them roll your pizza base you know it's going to be good.  Will come back again in fact I have probably with the family converted to pizza guru for our Friday pizza nights
5,27,Non-Binary,Research Assistant,Newtown,FALSE,,1,,,,"Got disappointed. Not good customer service. definitely not great pizza.We went there yesterday to dine in and saw the offer of installing app to get $5 discount. We made the order but been told by the staff that no specials are served in-store. We went with kids and family and though all the tables were empty and no other customers were in the store, they did not let us sit.We had to take away the pizza disappointing children. If the tables were busy and customers waiting, we could have understood.Quality of the pizza is definitely not good. Do not get carried away with the ratings."
6,60,Female,Nurse,Ryde,FALSE,,4,,,,"Ordered delivery from here. Overall very happy with the experience. Nice food, cooked well was delivered hot and the delivery driver was well presented and well mannered. Not too expensive."
7,36,Male,Construction Worker,Bankstown,FALSE,,5,5,5,5,"The Best Pizza & Pasta. Great food and lovely people. Very clean and nice vibe. Their bar (non-alcohol) is a great addition.  You'll be back again and again. Highly recommend the 'Mexico' pizza, yummm. Vegetarian options: Several Vegetarian and Vegan options. My favourite vegetarian option is the Creamy Veg Pasta with fettuccine. Dietary restrictions: Gluten free bases and vegan cheese available. Parking: Street parking or plenty around the back off the side street. Kid-friendliness: High chair available, pencils and colouring in sheets"
8,23,Female,College Student,Randwick,FALSE,,1,1,5,,Ordered for a fudge brownie and got the burnt food. Got the very rude response from the person working in the shop on 13/09/2024 around 11pm when called for the same. Very disappointing experience. Happened for the second time in a month.
9,40,Male,Chef,Mosman,TRUE,,3,2,4,3,"The service is reasonably fast. When picking up in store they have the screen that allows u to see how many orders are in front of u, and the status of your order which is convenient. The pizzas are tasty but the size of the pizza is ridiculosly small . A large pizza is like a medium pizza in comparison to say pizza hut. And it is actually quite expensive for these sizes. I emailed them at pizzashop@gmail.com and they never responded."
10,31,Female,Data Analyst,Chatswood,FALSE,,2,1,4,1,I ordered 2 spicy peppy paneer pizzas and I have been ordering the same for a while and I always like it. But today was a major disappointment.. Because the same favourite pizza was extremely spicy where I couldn't eat it. I called (with my number 06 1684 1572) and tried to give my feedback but they put my call on hold for several minutes.
